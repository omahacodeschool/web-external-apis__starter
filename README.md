# Web APIs Starter

Your goal with this assignment is to implement features that require consuming an external API.

You are provided with a static view that shows what information you'll need to display from the API. Visit <http://localhost:9292/example> to see the static view.

## Features

Users should be able to...

- View a list of cities
- Click a city to view that city's weather page
    - For your reference, the latitude and longitude of a couple cities are:
        - San Francisco: 37.7749, -122.4194
        - Omaha: 41.2524, -95.9980
        - Mumbai: 19.0760, 72.8777
- Refresh a city's weather page to see updated weather details

Don't worry about writing tests yet. We'll be going over that in a separate unit later.
